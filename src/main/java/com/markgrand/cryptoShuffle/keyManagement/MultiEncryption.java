/**
 * The crypto-shuffle package includes a convenient mechanism for creating a single JSON object that contains versions
 * of crypto-shuffle keys encrypted by each of a set of public keys. This is the `MultiEncryption` class.
 * <p>
 * To create a `MultiEncryption` object, you pass the constructor a plain text crypto-shuffle key and a collection of
 * one or more public keys. The constructed object contains versions of the crypto-shuffle key encrypted by each of the
 * public keys.
 * <p>
 * To decrypt the contents of a `MultiEncryption` object, pass a public key and its corresponding private key to the
 * `MultiEncryption` objectâ€™s `decrypt` method. If the `MultiEncryption` object contains an encrypted crypto-shuffle key
 * that was encrypted with the given public key, it uses the corresponding private key to decrypt the crypto-shuffle
 * key.
